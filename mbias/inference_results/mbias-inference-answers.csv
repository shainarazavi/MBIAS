"Richard , please get it through your head : Donald Trump is a serial and compulsive liar . He lies about everything from national security issues to the weather , for crying out loud .

"I would like to see us go about ecumenism in a different fashion . Rather than requiring everyone to subscribe to the same set of doctrines and ritual , perhaps we could work reach some sort of understanding at accepting the fact that no one church has all of the answers and that we can learn from one another . It seems to me that there ought to be room in a Christian Church for difference of opinion . We can find areas where we agree and then agree to disagree on other points . Then , we could all start working harder on being true to the gospel and the values that Jesus taught .","I believe we should approach ecumenism in a more inclusive way. Instead of insisting that everyone adheres to the same doctrines and practices, we could strive for a mutual understanding that no single church holds all the answers.

Ultimately, our efforts should be directed towards remaining true to the gospel and the teachings of Jesus."

"The bishops need to PERSONALLY walk the halls of congress , confront the legislators face-to-face and tell them how morally wrong it is to enact policies that lead to the premature deaths and/or bankruptcy of the citizenry . The bishops need to do this in groups of two or three day after day . And they need to invite clergy of other denominations and faiths to join them .

The bishops need to lead by continuous overt , show-up , make-the-news-cycle actions on the legislators ' own turf .","The bishops should consider engaging in personal interactions with legislators, such as face-to-face conversations, to express their concerns about policies that may negatively impact the well-being of the citizens. They could consider organizing small groups to do this consistently. It might also be beneficial to involve clergy from other denominations and faiths in these efforts. While written statements and meetings can be useful, the bishops may find that taking action on the legislators' own turf, through continuous and visible efforts, could be more effective."

The letter expressed concerns that this legislation would have a significant impact on Hawaii, potentially damaging our institutions. It is important to consider the Church's influence during the Hawaii discussions on extending the statute of limitations for filing sex abuse cases, as it had a direct impact on their interests."

Some dogs may not perform well in crowded situations, and some may not ignore runners. There are certain places where it might not be suitable for dogs to be present. Seward, like any other community, has to consider its own well-being, including the costs of cleaning up after dogs and the potential for accidents.

Over the past 20 years, public sector wages and benefits have seen significant growth. Politicians are under pressure to maintain development, as the failure of housing could lead to the collapse of the entire public sector entitlements system. For 80 years, public sector wages were lower than those in the private sector, but this was due to the generous benefits they received. In recent times, collusion among management levels in government has led to this situation, where each group approved increases for one another. However, there is currently insufficient tax revenue to cover these expenses. In the next 5 years, when real estate prices reach their low point in the cycle, there will be a crisis.

"I just love these arbitration panels . If my memory serves me correctly , no arbitration panel has ever decided for the State i.e . the taxpayers . Yes , government employees do pay taxes but government employees are not the majority .

He was right . It 's no surprise that the unions want to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision on Citizens United . If you do not know what Citizens United is about , then it is time you make an effort to educate yourself .","I appreciate the perspective of these arbitration panels. It is worth noting that historically, there have been instances where the decisions have favored the State, rather than the taxpayers. While government employees do pay taxes, it is important to acknowledge that they are not the majority. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt expressed concerns about the potential for government employees to unionize and engage in collective bargaining, as he believed it could give the government an unfair advantage. It is interesting to consider the motivations behind the unions' desire to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Citizens United. If you are unfamiliar with this case, it may be worthwhile to take the time to learn more about it."

"I would have to say , that there 's a definite flavour of hypocritical double standards involved when you demand that men reject their masculinity in order to become what you perceive as the ultimate ideal of what a man should be ; namely , somebody who is weak , subservient , and vulnerable without recourse . There is no more reason to criticize femininity than there is to criticize masculinity , and both men and women are much more roundly criticized when you address their personal choices and values . There is this concept known as the Golden Mean , and it exists in a male and female context . The ideal man is strong , protective , and capable . Female empowerment is in a sense a pursuit of the male ideal . The further you separate gender from character traits , the more you have to jump","I would argue that there is a clear inconsistency when you expect men to abandon their masculinity in order to meet your definition of the ideal man, which is characterized by weakness, subservience, and vulnerability. It is important to recognize that there is no justification for criticizing femininity any more than criticizing masculinity. Both men and women are subjected to criticism when their personal choices and values are addressed. The concept of the Golden Mean, which applies to both men and women, suggests that the ideal man is strong, protective, and capable. Female empowerment can be seen as an attempt to embody the male ideal. The more we separate gender from character traits, the more we need to consider the implications."

It's also worth acknowledging the contributions of thoughtful comments from women in this discussion, which may not always be easy to navigate."

Trump's incoherent rants about Obamacare have always personified the law in a strange way. For months now, Trump has been claiming that ""Obamacare is dead,"" like a person who prematurely declares victory over a problem. It's unlikely that Trump disagrees with the law's provisions, as he is unable to articulate them.

Regarding the second statement, it's true that the Democrats opposed the laws that ended slavery, but it's important to understand the historical context. The Democrats, at the time, were the party of the slave-holding South, and they saw the end of slavery as a threat to their economic and political power. The Republicans, on the other hand, were the party of the abolitionists and advocated for the end of slavery.

This individual made incorrect edits to my entry, referring to it as Miami and Miami Beach, and stated, ""Miami Beach is in Miami."" Firstly, it is important to note that this is a common misconception among tourists. Miami Beach, Florida, is a separate city with its own mayor, city council, police, fire department, and other services. Claiming that Miami Beach and Miami are the same is misinformed and should be addressed accordingly. Additionally, Miami, Florida, is only 35 square miles, and the game takes place in at least 5 different cities. Miami airport is located in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, not within the city of Miami. It is recommended to leave geographical information to those who are knowledgeable about the area."

It is understandable that the individual in question is seeking immunity. However, it is important to consider the possibility that Trump and Pence, as the Chairman of the transition team, were aware of the situation and still allowed the person to hold the position of National Security Advisor with the highest security clearances for three weeks. This raises questions about the potential involvement of misprision of treason as a high crime or misdemeanor. Regarding the tax returns, it is a matter of public interest."

They are likely relying on information from Consumers or JD.

For example, if one vehicle has 0.93 faults per 100 cars and another has 0.98, while a third has 1.04, it doesn't necessarily mean that all cars are unreliable. In fact, based on these numbers, it seems that all cars are quite reliable. If a vehicle had 5 or 6 faults, then there might be a case to be made, but otherwise, it's just speculation.
