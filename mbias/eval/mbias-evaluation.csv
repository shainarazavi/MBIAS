Trump's incoherent rants about Obamacare have always personified the law in a strange way. For months now, Trump has been claiming that ""Obamacare is dead,"" like a person who prematurely declares victory over a problem. It's unlikely that Trump disagrees with the law's provisions, as he is unable to articulate them. Trump's dislike for ""Obamacare"" stems from the fact that it reminds him of President Obama, whose accomplishments, popularity, self-made success, and knowledge are a source of frustration for Trump's fragile ego.

The same could be said about individuals who, like Trump and his associates, deny the impact of human activities on climate change and are planning to implement rules without considering the potential consequences. It is worth considering the weather records from December 22, 2016. In New York City, the temperature was 1 degree Celsius, while in the North Pole, it was also 1 degree Celsius. This raises a question: What is unusual about this situation? Regardless of who is correct or incorrect in the climate change debate, what if the actions proposed have irreversible consequences?
