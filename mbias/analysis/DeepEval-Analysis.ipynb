It is important to consider the potential impact of your vote on the election outcome. In your post, it seems like you are expressing excitement about the possibility that the Johnson candidacy could affect Ms. Clinton's chances of being elected. However, it is worth considering the potential implications of supporting a candidate who may not align with your values or priorities. It might be worth reconsidering your stance on this matter.\n",

My father, who was a professor at a college run by Jesuits, shared with me as a teenager that there is an old saying among the clergy. The idea is to keep women barefoot and pregnant, so that the laity will be too exhausted and have limited resources, making it difficult for them to challenge the church's rules and teachings. This is a disturbing notion, as it is based on the premise of controlling women's reproductive choices. It is important to recognize the importance of effective birth control in empowering women and advocating for justice in the church.\n",

She faced challenges in managing the Imi'Ike Club during her last year at the school, causing distress to parents through unpleasant emails. Her behavior was also perceived as bullying, which led to the disbanding of her club teams after the RENO qualifier. Despite these issues, she continued to threaten parents and showed disdain for the ILH Athletes. Her temperament was described as extremely bad and unprofessional. As a volleyball player at UH and the Olympics, she was highly regarded for her skills as a setter. It was suggested that she might have been better off staying with Las Vegas Aces Volleyball Club. She was known to close practices to address her insecurities, which some felt was a way to hide her vulnerabilities. The state's scrutiny of her actions was intense, with many keeping a close watch on her every day.\n",

Seward, like any other community, has to consider its own well-being, including the costs of cleaning up after dogs and the potential for accidents.

      "Biased text:  I just love these arbitration panels . If my memory serves me correctly , no arbitration panel has ever decided for the State i.e . the taxpayers . Yes , government employees do pay taxes but government employees are not the majority . President Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on the record to have said that government employees should never be allowed to unionize and have the right to strike and collective bargaining because it would put the government to an unfair advantage . He was right . It 's no surprise that the unions want to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision on Citizens United . If you do not know what Citizens United is about , then it is time you make an effort to educate yourself .\n",

      " Debiased text:  I appreciate the perspective of these arbitration panels. It is worth noting that historically, there have been instances where the decisions have favored the State, rather than the taxpayers. While government employees do pay taxes, it is important to acknowledge that they are not the majority. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt expressed concerns about the potential for government employees to unionize and engage in collective bargaining, as he believed it could give the government an unfair advantage. It is interesting to consider the motivations behind the unions' desire to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Citizens United. If you are unfamiliar with this case, it may be worthwhile to take the time to learn more about it.\n",
